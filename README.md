## Amy Balmforth

I'm an enthusiastic software developer with a curiosity for learning and a passion for building interesting projects with code. After a successful eleven-year career in logistics within the luxury industry, I decided I was ready for a new challenge and joined Makers Academy to hone my software development skills. As a teenager I had an interest in IT and enjoyed coding my own websites with HTML but never considered it as a potential career path. I have relished learning new things every day at Makers and I now look forward to building my new career in software development. I am looking for an exciting developer role in a company that encourages learning in a supportive environment, has an engineer-led Agile mindset and is somewhere I can make a difference from day one. I am particularly interested in learning more about containerisation and microservices: I believe these can allow teams to be more flexible, build better products more easily and allow businesses to drive innovation.

I've kept a blog as a record of my experience learning to code here: https://amylearnstocode.wordpress.com

## Skills

#### Adaptability

* Confident in learning and using new technologies quickly:
  * Picked up a number of new technologies within two weeks in order to build my final group project at Makers: ReactJS, Express, Cypress, Sinon
  * Learned Ruby on Rails in a short time: was able to build a group project (social network website) and an individual project (photo-sharing social network website) within two weeks of first taking up Rails
* Self-led learning - was able to research and learn how to make API calls for a weekend project when this had not previously been taught during the course
* I am able to work individually and in a group: I completed all the individual weekend challenges set by Makers, I also completed three successful group projects and got positive feedback on the role I played within each group

#### Behavioural skills and best practices

* Agile: Practiced Agile ways of working during group projects at Makers: Scrum, sprints, daily stand-ups, retrospectives, Kanban
* TDD: Can employ test-driven development to break down and solve any problem
* Pair programming: paired throughout the course at Makers including on group projects - ensured that pairs switched tasks regularly in order to ensure each team member got exposure to every part of the project

#### Working towards a goal

* Prioritisation: Used to working efficiently under pressure to strict deadlines and organising tasks accordingly
* Iterative development: committing to an MVP, working towards it, reviewing if necessary
* Hard worker: Committed to delivering successful outcomes

#### Problem solving

* Able to break complicated coding problems down into more manageable problems or user stories. For example one weekend challenge at Makers required me to build a bowling game - I was able to write my own user stories in order to break the problem down into steps to guide myself through the process of building a more complex game involving different rules for strike, spare, etc.
* Roles in my previous career required solutions to highly bespoke problems - for high end clients. I regularly devised elegant solutions to deliver sold pieces to clients - extremely demanding ultra high net worth individuals

#### Communication

* I am able to communicate effectively in a group situation in order to unite the team and ensure we are on track to complete the given task. For example in our final group project at Makers we ran into some issues and conflict of interest within the team during the initial planning stage of the project. I was able to bring the group together to discuss our priorities, and ensure that we came to an agreement on the direction of the project going forwards that each team member was satisfied with
* In my previous career I worked in a cross-functional role where I built relationships with key stakeholders from all levels of the business, local and international
* Used my skills honed in the luxury business world to act as a valued and trusted member of the team on group projects at Makers, supporting other team members and making sure that everyone was listened to

#### Project and team leadership

* Leadership experience gained in previous career:
  * Team leadership for three international sales events, looking after high end jewellery stock valued at over Â£100 million
  * Led a team of fourteen people, planned the team rota and led training sessions to ensure the team was adequately prepared
  * My team was praised for our organisation and professionalism and were sought out to work on future events
* I have put these skills into practice at Makers - for example during our final group project I communicated with each team member to check they were clear on their part of the final product presentation, and organised for the team to set aside time to run through the presentation to make sure it went as smoothly and professionally as possible on the day
