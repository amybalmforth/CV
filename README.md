## Amy Balmforth

I'm an enthusiastic software developer with a curiosity for learning and a passion for building interesting projects with code. After a successful eleven-year career in logistics within the luxury industry, I decided I was ready for a new challenge: I wanted a career where I can learn new things every day and build solutions that drive real business impact. I've just graduated from Makers Academy, an intensive 12-week full-stack software development bootcamp, and I'm now looking for an exciting developer role in a company that has an engineer-led Agile mindset and is somewhere I can make a difference from day one. I'm particularly interested in learning more about containerisation and microservices: I believe these allow teams more flexibility, reduce dependencies and give developers more control.
