## Amy Balmforth

I'm an enthusiastic software developer with a curiosity for learning and a passion for building interesting projects with code. I'm a career changer: after a successful eleven years working in logistics for the luxury industry, I decided I wanted a career where I can learn new things every day and build solutions that drive real business impact. I’m currently working as a junior Python developer - unfortunately the company is running out of money so I am now looking for my next challenge. I retrained at Makers Academy, a 12-week full-stack software development bootcamp. I'm looking for an exciting junior developer role in a company that has an engineer-led Agile mindset and is somewhere I can make a difference from day one.
