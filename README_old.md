## Amy Balmforth

I'm an enthusiastic software developer with a curiosity for learning and a passion for building interesting projects with code. After a successful eleven-year career in logistics within the luxury industry, I decided I was ready for a new challenge and joined Makers Academy to hone my software development skills. I relish learning new things every day and look forward to growing my programming knowledge in an exciting developer role in a company that encourages learning in a supportive environment.

As preparation for my career change and starting Makers Academy, I followed the Odin Project: Web Development 101 course, learning the command line, git workflow, HTML, CSS, and getting an introduction to Rails. I attended the London Rails Girls workshop in December 2018 which inspired me to start learning Ruby. I ranked up to 5 kyu level on Codewars Ruby katas before starting onsite study at Makers. I've blogged about my experience learning to code here: http://amylearnstocode.wordpress.com
